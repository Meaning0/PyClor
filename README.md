Python Code Cleaning Tool
In fact, the main function is to implement, increase readability, of course, there is also an error indentation to deal with that kind of error, can also be detected, but most IDEs also have this function, as an addition (but it is really hard to write).  My original intention is that I have to learn a lot about other people's code recently. In the process, I might as well have code that is not standardized and does not handle errors (such as indentation errors), but it is still attached (and very laborious), so I have to detect the function more useful than modifying the indentation of errors.
